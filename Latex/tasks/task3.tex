In order to compute the number of connected components in each graph we use the following result:
\begin{thm}
    Let \(G = (\mathcal{V}, W)\) be a finite graph and let \(L\) be its laplacian matrix. Then \(L\) has \(\lambda = 0\) as an eigenvalue and its algebraic multiplicity correspond to the number of connected components in \(G\).
\end{thm}
\\
Using the Matlab function \texttt{eigs} we can compute the smallest \(C = 6\) eigenvalues of both graphs and for each value of \(K\) obtaining the following results:
